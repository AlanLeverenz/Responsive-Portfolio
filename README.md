# Responsive-Portfolio
non-Bootstrap responsive version of portfolio

This code is based on the Basic-Portfolio-Update repository. I applied the @media max-widths as per the instructions and the sample images.

One thing I could not solve is how the work images flow when the screen width changes allowing only two images per row. Even though all the div.work elements have the same coding and values, the 5th div floats to the right, pushing the 6th and final div to the next row.
